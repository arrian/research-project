# Final Presentation

## Intro [Slide 2]
-my name is Arrian Purcell
-my project is titled.. "Art and Understanding through Code Visualisation"

## The Problem [Slide 3]

(what is the existing problem that needs to be solved?)

Live coding has a problem:
-audiences may feel distracted or excluded from the live coding performance
-live coder may wish to communicate more through there code

-how can we improve source code comprehension?
-how can we aid understanding of the programming process?
-how can we improve enjoyment of live coding?
-better yet, how can we align the mental models of the programmer and the audience?

-techniques such as software diagrams aren’t dynamic or flexible
-don’t allow for close to realtime understanding
-difficult for uninformed audiences to get a sense of what is going on

-visualisations have been identified in the literature as a means to overcome many of these problems
-nevertheless, there has been few empirical studies evaluating the application of visualisations to live coding
-it would be valuable to use visualisations as a means to communicate the programmer’s intention

## The Project [Slide 4]

(what was this project about?)

-this project explored code visualisations
-specifically, it investigated visuals within the domains of software and music
-used live coding as a platform and case study for this

-live coding can be broadly defined as writing a program while it runs
-live coding is identified as the artistic process of musical and visual expression through programming with the goal of entertaining or educating an audience
-typically, code is written to produce music or visual while an audience observes
-obviously, there is variation within the audience regarding skill in programming...
	-some may never have seen programming before
	-others may be quite experienced
	-many other levels between

-this project developed and tested visualisations on audiences within live coding, addressing two dimensions of understanding and enjoyment

## Hypothesis [Slide 5]

-this project investigated the proposition that ``code visualisation improves observer understanding and enjoyment'' in the setting of a live arts practice. 

-more specifically, this project investigated the question ``can the application of visualisation techniques to live coding enhance audience experience by increasing understanding and enjoyment?''.

-let's unpack this hypothesis...
	-the application of visualisation techniques refers to examining ways of introducing software visualisation techniques to a dynamic coding process
	-to live coding... where live coding in this case is a more dynamic method of programming than traditional software development
	-to enhance audience experience... the audience can experience something on many levels... in this case it was identified within the literature that the audience might have a sense of exclusion or feel distracted during a live coding performance
	-finally, understanding and enjoyment... these dimensions were the common thread throughout the studies and variables we attempted to manipulate


## Structure [Slide 6]

-the hypothesis was examined through a process of exploratory field studies, prototype development, user study evaluation and refinement.

-this included:

-exploratory field study - inform the direction of the dev of visuals
-prototype 1 - developing the first iteration of the visaual informed by the exploratory field study
-user study - develop a method for evaluating the visuals and evaluate the prototype under laboratory conditions
-prototype 2 - develop the next iteration of the prototype, fixing limitations identified and building on the results of the user study
-follow-up user study - again evaluate the prototype under laboratory conditions to compare improvements

## Exploratory Field Study [Slide 7]

method:

-survey of a live coding audience following a performance at an arts festival
-only the source code was projected, no visuals

-asked the audience to self-report their enjoyment and understanding through stages of the performance including the beginning, middle and end.

-total of 13 responses

results:

-more than 50% indicated that enjoyment remained high or increased through the performance
-however, 38% of the audience found aspects of the performance confusing
-many of these indicated that their understanding of the performance decreased as it progressed
-this suggested that it might be beneficial to reduce confusion within the space of live coding.

discussion:

-the results of this study indicated that:
-understanding during the early stages of the performance was shown to be high but drifted as more code was added
-as their understanding drifted during the middle and end of the performance, changes were apparent to the audience but their intention was not clear
-one notable response indicated that they didn't have a big picture of what the entirety of the code looked like, limiting their ability to comprehend the performance.

-however, didn't get quite enough information from this survey, so a follow-up email interview was conducted with a few of those present at the performance.
-these interviewees indicated that an increase in understanding might contribute positively to the audience's experience of the performance.

## Prototype 1 [Slide 8]

rationale:

-field study indicated that there might be a benefit in introducing visuals to live coding
-with a goal of increasing understanding
-based on these results:
	-wished to examine if the audiences enjoyment could be enhanced
	-wished to examine if the audiences understanding could be enhanced

design:

-to achieve this, two sets of visualiastions were developed
-one targetting audience understanding... was labelled the didactic condition.
-one targetting audience enjoyment... was labelled the aesthetic condition.

-result (images/video):

-I have a short video snippet from both conditions that i will play now

-first the aesthetic condition

-secondly the didactic condition

## User Study

method:

-wished to evaluate the aesthetic and didactic visualsations developed in a real-life (or close to life) scenario

## Summary [Slide 11]

-number of iterations of prototype visualisations
-number of user studies have been conducted
-results of studies indicate...

## Contributions [Slide 12]

-a method of software visualisation has been identified and evaluated
	-up to now there has been no attempt to evaluate visualsations within the space of live coding
	-the method of process-driven visualisation identified has included a combination of static and dynamic code analysis and presentation to audiences during live coding performances.

-method of evaluating software visualisations within a live performance space
	-due to the development of the software visualisation prototype and the application to the live coding space 
	-the more general implications of this method of visualisation evaluation may be useful in the evaluation of software developed for large audiences and audiences observing an individual developing software.

-OzCHI short paper has been accepted entitled "Visualising a Live Coding Arts Process"
	-discusses the results of the field study and the first user study
	-includes anonymous reviews such as:
		-"the questions raised are worthwhile and interesting"
		-"the paper describes interesting work"
		-"an interesting paper, and certainly a novel contribution"

## Future Work [Slide 13]

-just the beginning of what is possible within this area
-much potential to identify what audiences really find interesting and worthwhile within the process of live coding
-much potential to harness the data that has been extracted. few dynamic software visualisation techniques have been developed... take these ideas further integrating them into the live coding process
-more comprehensive user studies... clear up some of the technical challenges encountered... for example using two projectors, one with source code, one with the visualisation

-future work will examine 

## Conclusion [Slide 14]

-coming back to the hypothesis:
	``can the application of visualisation techniques to live coding enhance audience experience by increasing understanding and enjoyment?''



-can we combine these domain-specific visualisations in a meaningful way?
-how can we use this to aid in code comprehension?
