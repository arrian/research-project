# Final Presentation

## Intro [Slide 2]
-  my name is Arrian Purcell
-  my project is titled.. "Art and Understanding through Code Visualisation"

## The Problem [Slide 3]

(what is the existing problem that needs to be solved?)

Live coding has a problem:
-  audiences may feel distracted or excluded from the live coding performance
-  live coder may wish to communicate more through there code

-  how can we improve source code comprehension?
-  how can we aid understanding of the programming process?
-  how can we improve enjoyment of live coding?
-  better yet, how can we align the mental models of the programmer and the audience?

-  techniques such as software diagrams aren’t dynamic or flexible
-  don’t allow for close to realtime understanding
-  difficult for uninformed audiences to get a sense of what is going on

-  visualisations have been identified in the literature as a means to overcome many of these problems
-  nevertheless, there has been few empirical studies evaluating the application of visualisations to live coding
-  it would be valuable to use visualisations as a means to communicate the programmer’s intention

## The Project [Slide 4]

(what was this project about?)

-  this project explored code visualisations
-  specifically, it investigated visuals within the domains of software and music
-  used live coding as a platform and case study for this

## Live Coding [Slide 5]

-  live coding can be broadly defined as writing a program while it runs
-  live coding is identified as the artistic process of musical and visual expression through programming with the goal of entertaining or educating an audience
-  typically, code is written to produce music or visual while an audience observes
-  obviously, there is variation within the audience regarding skill in programming...
	-some may never have seen programming before
	-others may be quite experienced
	-many other levels between

-  this project developed and tested visualisations on audiences within live coding, addressing two dimensions of understanding and enjoyment

## Hypothesis [Slide 6]

-  this project investigated the proposition that ``code visualisation improves observer understanding and enjoyment'' in the setting of a live arts practice. 

-  more specifically, this project investigated the question ``can the application of visualisation techniques to live coding enhance audience experience by increasing understanding and enjoyment?''.

-  let's unpack this hypothesis...
	-the application of visualisation techniques refers to examining ways of introducing software visualisation techniques to a dynamic coding process
	-to live coding... where live coding in this case is a more dynamic method of programming than traditional software development
	-to enhance audience experience... the audience can experience something on many levels... in this case it was identified within the literature that the audience might have a sense of exclusion or feel distracted during a live coding performance
	-finally, understanding and enjoyment... these dimensions were the common thread throughout the studies and variables we attempted to manipulate


## Structure [Slide 7]

-  the hypothesis was examined through a process of exploratory field studies, prototype development, user study evaluation and refinement.

-  this included:

-  exploratory field study - inform the direction of the dev of visuals
-  prototype 1 - developing the first iteration of the visaual informed by the exploratory field study
-  user study - develop a method for evaluating the visuals and evaluate the prototype under laboratory conditions
-  prototype 2 - develop the next iteration of the prototype, fixing limitations identified and building on the results of the user study
-  follow-up user study - again evaluate the prototype under laboratory conditions to compare improvements

## Exploratory Field Study [Slide 8]

method:

-  survey of a live coding audience following a performance at an arts festival
-  only the source code was projected, no visuals

-  asked the audience to self-report their enjoyment and understanding through stages of the performance including the beginning, middle and end.

-  total of 13 responses

results:

-  more than 50% indicated that enjoyment remained high or increased through the performance
-  however, 38% of the audience found aspects of the performance confusing
-  many of these indicated that their understanding of the performance decreased as it progressed
-  this suggested that it might be beneficial to reduce confusion within the space of live coding.

discussion:

-  the results of this study indicated that:
-  understanding during the early stages of the performance was shown to be high but drifted as more code was added
-  as their understanding drifted during the middle and end of the performance, changes were apparent to the audience but their intention was not clear
-  one notable response indicated that they didn't have a big picture of what the entirety of the code looked like, limiting their ability to comprehend the performance.

-  however, didn't get quite enough information from this survey, so a follow-up email interview was conducted with a few of those present at the performance.
-  these interviewees indicated that an increase in understanding might contribute positively to the audience's experience of the performance.

## Prototype 1 [Slide 9]

rationale:

-  field study indicated that there might be a benefit in introducing visuals to live coding
-  with a goal of increasing understanding
-  based on these results:
	-wished to examine if the audiences enjoyment could be enhanced
	-wished to examine if the audiences understanding could be enhanced

design:

-  to achieve this, two sets of visualiastions were developed
-  one targetting audience understanding... was labelled the didactic condition.
-  one targetting audience enjoyment... was labelled the aesthetic condition.

result (images/video):

-  I have a short video snippet from both conditions that i will play now

-  first the aesthetic condition

-  secondly the didactic condition


## User Study [Slide 10]

method:

-  wished to evaluate the aesthetic and didactic visuals developed in a real-life (or close to life) scenario as possible
-  ran a lab study performance... the live coder used the visuals developed and performed a song for an audience
-  audience was exposed to both conditions
-  two audience groups, conditions were order balanced
-  completed a survey

results:

-  total of 41 respondents
-  both visualisations resulted in high enjoyment, more found the aesthetic visualiastion enjoyable (76% compared to 56%)
-  understanding was more complex

-  expected that the didactic condition would result in higher understanding than aesthetic
-  however, it was more complex than this

[explain graph]
-  these graphs show the results of the audience survey
-  it shows the self-reported understanding of the audience throughout the performance for aesthetic condition
-  understanding is measured as high medium or low
-  x axis is the stage of the performance
-  you can trace an audience member's understanding, for example one audience member stated that their understanding was high->low->low

## Graph Understanding Aesthetic [Slide 10a]

-  Take note of the group with low understanding at the beginning of the performance
-  Also take note of the group with high understanding during the middle of the performance

## Graph Understanding Didactic [Slide 10b]

-  If we now compare this with the didactic condition we see that the didactic condition had a larger group with lower understanding at the beginning of the performance
-  as we move into the middle of the performance, we see fewer have high understanding, more have medium understanding

discussion:

-  this was not expected. the didactic condition appeared to cause more confusion at the beginning of the performance.
-  perhaps due to a number of factors:
	-visualisation obscuring code
	-initial complexity of the didatic visualisations
	-musical taste?

-  these issues needed to be examined further

<!-- -this was just one of the questions... -->

<!-- -after conducting an interview with the live coder and comparing this with the audience,  -->

## Prototype 2 [Slide 11]

rationale:

-  goal of aligning the mental model of the audience with that of the live coder
-  address the limitations identified in the previous study

design:

-  developed one visualisation taking features from previous iteration aesthetic and didactic conditions
-  visualised high level code structure and high level live coder actions

## Summary [Slide 12]

-  number of iterations of prototype visualisations
-  number of user studies have been conducted
-  results of studies indicate that there is potential for manipulating enjoyment and understanding
-  

## Contributions [Slide 13]

-  a method of software visualisation has been identified and evaluated
	-up to now there has been no attempt to evaluate visualsations within the space of live coding
	-the method of process-driven visualisation identified has included a combination of static and dynamic code analysis and presentation to audiences during live coding performances.

-  method of evaluating software visualisations within a live performance space
	-due to the development of the software visualisation prototype and the application to the live coding space 
	-the more general implications of this method of visualisation evaluation may be useful in the evaluation of software developed for large audiences and audiences observing an individual developing software.

-  OzCHI short paper has been accepted entitled "Visualising a Live Coding Arts Process"
	-discusses the results of the field study and the first user study
	-includes anonymous reviews such as:
		-"the questions raised are worthwhile and interesting"
		-"the paper describes interesting work"
		-"an interesting paper, and certainly a novel contribution"

## Future Work [Slide 14]

-  just the beginning of what is possible within this area
-  much potential to identify what audiences really find interesting and worthwhile within the process of live coding
-  much potential to harness the data that has been extracted. few dynamic software visualisation techniques have been developed... take these ideas further integrating them into the live coding process
-  more comprehensive user studies... clear up some of the technical challenges encountered... for example using two projectors, one with source code, one with the visualisation

-  future work will examine further itegration of visualisations with live coding. eg. live coded visuals
-visualisations showing the process of programming

## Conclusion [Slide 15]

-  coming back to the hypothesis:
	``can the application of visualisation techniques to live coding enhance audience experience by increasing understanding and enjoyment?''

-  can we combine these domain-specific visualisations in a meaningful way?
-  how can we use this to aid in code comprehension?
