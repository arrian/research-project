# Final Presentation

## Intro [Slide 2]
-my name is Arrian Purcell
-my project is titled.. "Art and Understanding through Code Visualisation"

## The Problem [Slide 3]

(what is the existing problem that needs to be solved?)

Live coding has a problem:
-audiences may feel distracted or excluded from the performance
-live coder may wish to communicate more through there code

-how can we improve source code comprehension?
-how can we aid understanding of the programming process?
-how can we improve enjoyment of live coding?
-better yet, how can we align the mental models of the programmer and the audience?

-techniques such as [...] aren’t dynamic or flexible
-don’t allow for close to realtime understanding
-difficult for uninformed audiences to get a sense of what is going on
-visualisations have been identified in the literature as a means to overcome many of these problems
-nevertheless, there has been few empirical studies evaluating the application of visualisations to live coding
-it would be valuable to use visualisations as a means to communicate the programmer’s intention

## The Project [Slide 4]

(what was this project about?)

-this project explored code visualisations
-specifically, it investigated visuals within the domains of software and music, in live coding
-used live coding as a platform and case study for this (will discuss later)
-developed and tested visualisations on audiences with audiences of varied levels of experience with programming, addressing two dimensions of understanding and enjoyment

## Hypothesis [Slide 5]

This project investigated the proposition that ``code visualisation improves observer understanding and enjoyment'' in the setting of a live arts practice. 

More specifically, this project investigated the question ``can the application of visualisation techniques to live coding enhance audience experience by increasing understanding and enjoyment?''.

These questions were examined through a process of prototype development, user study evaluation and refinement.

## Structure [Slide 6]

-exploratory field study - inform the direction of the study
-prototype 1 - develop a visualisation for evaluation informed by the exploratory field study
-user study - evaluate the prototype under laboratory conditions
-prototype 2 - develop the next iteration of the prototype, fixing limitations identified and building on the results of the user study
-follow-up user study - again evaluate the prototype under laboratory conditions to compare improvements

## Summary [Slide 11]

-number of iterations of prototype visualisations
-number of user studies have been conducted
-results of studies indicate...

## Contributions [Slide 12]

-a method of software visualisation has been identified and evaluated
	-up to now there has been no attempt to evaluate visualsations within the space of live coding
	-the method of process-driven visualisation identified has included a combination of static and dynamic code analysis and presentation to audiences during live coding performances.

-a strategy for developing visualisations using a software engineering approach has been identified
	-this approach has involved collaboration with a musical artist with the application of a software engieering design, iteration and validation approach through a variety of field and user studies.

-method of evaluating software visualisations within a live performance space
	-due to the development of the software visualisation prototype and the application to the live coding space 
	-the more general implications of this method of visualisation evaluation may be useful in the evaluation of software developed for large audiences and audiences observing an individual developing software.

-OzCHI paper has been accepted entitled ``Visualising a Live Coding Arts Process''
	-discusses the results of the field study and the first user study
	-includes anonymous reviews such as:
		-``the questions raised are worthwhile and interesting''
		-``the paper describes interesting work''
		-``an interesting paper, and certainly a novel contribution''

## Future Work [Slide 13]

-just the beginning of this examination
-much potential to identify what audiences really find interesting and worthwhile within the process of live coding
-

## Conclusion [Slide 14]

``code visualisation improves observer understanding and enjoyment''

``can the application of visualisation techniques to live coding enhance audience experience by increasing understanding and enjoyment?''

-can we combine these domain-specific visualisations in a meaningful way?
-how can we use this to aid in code comprehension?
