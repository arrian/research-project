Questions from Presentation:

How did you recruit participants?
Two conditions + separate groups?

Performance consistency?

What do you think from the experience? Feedback (qualitative)? -> what were blockers or the inverse blocker?

Educational experiences as future work?

Didactic. How might this change through the performance? Names, changes etc.

Be clear about how the visualisations in the experiment change, links + what they represent with code.

Placement, colours -> are they meaningful? Why did you choose what you did?

Live coding for visuals instead of audio. Crossover + conflicts? Can you have both at once?

What have you learned + what was super hard?


Thoughts from Emily:
-mismatch between labels with def ______ <- name?
-hexagon -> you should have told us what it meant
