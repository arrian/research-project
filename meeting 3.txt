Should run through ben’s live coding videos

what do they understand now
what do they enjoy now

alternatively:
what do they understand in the code now
what do they enjoy in the code now

what do they understand in the music now
what do they enjoy in the music now



now->then

categorise visualisations

code vs music

what did you pay attention to

Henry’s Observations on the McLean Paper

Thanks for the papers. I looked at the McLean et al paper just now. My impressions:

1) Very interesting. But it is descriptive without any formal study as yet.
2) The Blackwell and Collins paper is cited as the fundamental study; you need to read this paper.
3) The introduction is a bit hand wavy but contains some useful observations for you. You picked up on "enjoyment" and "understanding". But I would add to these "distracted" and "excluded" as targets to evaluate from the audience perspective.
4) Notions of "chunking" and "spactial dance" are possibly useful considerations of cognition.
5) They talk about symbols, shape and geometry in comprehension of computation. Can you think about (or find references to ) symbols, shape, geometry in music visualisation?
6) They talk about custom programming languages. As a challenge, perhaps you can come up with visualisations which are language independent?
7) The observation about "time" being preceived differently between performer and audience is interesting and perhaps a rich area to delve into.
8) I increasingly like the idea of the "is it really live" experiment. I think that this is new and different and fun and might sell the work.
