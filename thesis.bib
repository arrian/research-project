abstract = {A true science of data visualizations requires both a theory of perception and of computer graphics. However, visualization designers have paid relatively little attention to perceptual issues. In this article, I outline how knowledge of human visual perception and physiology can lead to more effective visualizations. Bertin's (1983) Image Theory, the only comprehensive perceptual theory in the visualization literature, will serve as the medium for the discussion. Experimental vision research grounds Image Theory in "first-principles" and suggests corrections, modifications and extensions. The resulting updated version of Image Theory can serve as a guide to visualization design.},

abstract = {Despite a diversity of software architectures supporting information visualization, it is often difficult to identify, evaluate, and re-apply the design solutions implemented within such frameworks. One popular and effective approach for addressing such difficulties is to capture successful solutions in design patterns, abstract descriptions of interacting software components that can be customized to solve design problems within a particular context. Based upon a review of existing frameworks and our own experiences building visualization software, we present a series of design patterns for the domain of information visualization. We discuss the structure, context of use, and interrelations of patterns spanning data representation, graphics, and interaction. By representing design knowledge in a reusable form, these patterns can be used to facilitate software design, implementation, and evaluation, and improve developer education and communication.},

abstract = {In this paper a system for continuous analysis, visualization and classification of musical streams is proposed. The system performs visualization and classification task by means of three high-level, semantic features extracted computing a reduction on a multidi- mensional low-level feature vector through the usage of Gaussian Mixture Models. The visualization of the semantic characteristics of the audio stream has been implemented by mapping the value of the high-level features on a triangular plot and by assigning to each feature a primary color. In this manner, besides having the representation of musical evolution of the signal, we have also ob- tained representative colors for each musical part of the analyzed streams. The classification exploits a set of one-against-one three- dimensional Support Vector Machines trained on some target gen- res. The obtained results on visualization and classification tasks are very encouraging: our tests on heterogeneous genre streams have shown the validity of proposed approach.},

While several sets of heuristics have been used or proposed for InfoVis, it is not yet known what kind of heuristics are useful for finding general InfoVis problems. We performed a meta-analysis with the goal of exploring the issues of heuristic evaluation for InfoVis. This meta-analysis concentrates on issues pertaining to the selection and organi- zation of heuristics, and the process itself. For this purpose, we used three sets of previously published heuristics to assess a visual decision support system that is used to examine sim- ulation data. The meta-analysis shows that the evaluation process and results have a high dependency on the heuris- tics and the types of evaluators chosen. We describe issues related to interpretation, redundancy, and conflict in heuris- tics. We also provide a discussion of generalizability and categorization of these heuristics.},

A color raster graphics display is used to generate images of notes, chords, and chord progressions based on this theory.

By varying certain image parameters, different "brush stroke" effects may be obtained.

This is useful because implementers can quickly identify various techniques that can be applied to their domain of interest. However, these taxonomies do not help the implementers understand how to apply and implement these techniques. In this paper, we will extend and then propose a new way to taxonomize information visualization techniques by using the Data State Model [Chi98]. In fact, as the taxonomic analysis in this paper will show, many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused. The paper shows that the Data State Model not only helps researchers understand the space of design, but also helps implementers understand how information visualization techniques can be applied more broadly.},

abstract = {Music players for personal computers are often featured with music visualization by generating animated patterns according to the music’s low-level features such as loudness and spectrum. This paper proposes an emotion-based music player which synchronizes visualization (photos) with music based on the emotions evoked by auditory stimulus of music and visual content of visualization. For emotion detection from photos, we collected 398 photos with their emotions annotated by 496 users through the web. With these annotations, a Bayesian classification method is proposed for automatic photo emotion detection. For emotion detection from music, we adopt an existing method. Finally, for composition of music and photos, in addition to matching high-level emotions, we also consider low-level feature harmony and temporal visual coherence. It is formulated as an optimization problem and solved by a greedy algorithm. Subjective evaluation shows emotion-based music visualization enriches users’ listening experiences.},

The authors propose a novel and systematic taxonomy of six areas making up thirty characteristic features of software visualization technology.

abstract = {We present the novel high-level visualization taxonomy. Our taxonomy classifies visualization algorithms rather than data. Algorithms are categorized based on the assumptions they make about the data being visualized; we call this set of assumptions the design model. Because our taxonomy is based on design models, it is more flexible than existing taxonomies and considers the user's conceptual model, emphasizing the human aspect of visualization. Design models are classified according to whether they are discrete or continuous and by how much the algorithm designer chooses display attributes such as spatialization, timing, colour, and transparency. This novel approach provides an alternative view of the visualization field that helps explain how traditional divisions (e.g., information and scientific visualization) relates and overlap, and that may inspire research ideas in hybrid visualization areas},

abstract = {Glyphs (also referred to as icons) are graphical entities that convey one or more data values via attributes such as shape, size, color, and position. They have been widely used in the visualization of data and information, and are especially well suited for displaying complex, multivariate data sets. The placement or layout of glyphs on a display can communicate significant information regarding the data values themselves as well as relationships between data points, and a wide assortment of placement strategies have been developed to date. Methods range from simply using data dimensions as positional attributes to basing placement on implicit or explicit structure within the data set. This paper presents an overview of multivariate glyphs, a list of issues regarding the layout of glyphs, and a comprehensive taxonomy of placement strategies to assist the visualization designer in selecting the technique most suitable to his or her data and task. Examples, strengths, weaknesses, and design considerations are given for each category of technique. We conclude with some general guidelines for selecting a placement strategy, along with a brief description of some of our future research directions.},

@article{Milgram1994,
abstract = {This paper focuses on Mixed Reality (MR) visual displays, a particular subset of Virtual Reality (VR) related technologies that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds somewhere along the "virtuality continuum" which connects completely real environments to completely virtual ones. Probably the best known of these is Augmented Reality (AR), which refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However, an attempt to distinguish these classes on the basis of whether they are primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the real world is viewed directly or via some electronic display medium, whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the world or on the outside looking in, and whether or not the scale of the display is intended to map orthoscopically onto the real world leads to quite different groupings among the six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. The 'obvious' distinction between the terms "real" and "virtual" is shown to have a number of different aspects, depending on whether one is dealing with real or virtual objects, real or virtual images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these. An (approximately) three dimensional taxonomy is proposed, comprising the following dimensions: Extent of World Knowledge ("how much do we know about the world being displayed?"), Reproduction Fidelity ("how 'realistically' are we able to display it?"), and Extent of Presence Metaphor ("what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present within that world?"). key words: virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR)},

Open Sound Control (OSC) mes- sages are used to trigger sound events, where each OSC parameter may be expressed as a pattern. Tidal is designed to allow patterns to be created and modified during a live coded performance, aided by terse, expressive syntax and integration with an emerging time synchronisation stan- dard. 1.},

abstract = {All music performances are generative to the extent that the actions of performers produce musical sounds, but in this article the authors focus on performative interaction with generative music in a more compositional sense. In particular they discuss how live coding of music involves the building and management of generative processes. They suggest that the human interaction with generative processes that occurs in live coding provides a unique perspective on the generative music landscape. Especially significant is the way in which generative algorithms are represented in code to best afford interaction and modification during performance. They also discuss the features of generative processes that make them more or less suitable for live coding performances. They situate live coding practice within historical and theoretical contexts and ground the discussion with regular reference to their experiences performing in the live coding duo aa-cell.},

abstract = {While collaborative approaches in the classroom have been shown to be highly beneficial for students of computer science, obstacles inherent in today’s academic environment often prevent collocated collaborative approaches from being implemented. One solution to the collocation problem may lie with tools that facilitate distributed collaboration. This paper presents RIPPLE (Remote Interactive Pair Programming and Learning Environment), a development environment for distributed synchronous collaborative programming. RIPPLE is an open source software tool. Initial user tests demonstrate positive responses from students, and the potential for long term learning, motivation, and retention benefits is significant. In addition to its benefits for students, RIPPLE is a tool for computing education researchers who wish to collect data on collaborative programming.},

abstract = {Mood or emotion information are often used search terms or navigation properties within multimedia archives, retrieval systems or multimedia players. Most of these applications engage end-users or experts to tag multimedia objects with mood annotations. Within the scientific community different approaches for content-based music, photo or multimodal mood classification can be found with a wide range of used mood definitions or models and completely different test suites. The purpose of this paper is to review common mood models in order to assess their exibility, to present a generic multi-modal mood classification framework which uses various audio-visual features and multiple classifiers and to present a novel music and photo mood classification reference set for evaluation. The classification framework is the basis for different applications e.g. automatic media tagging or music slideshow players. The novel reference set can be used for comparison of different algorithms from various research groups. Finally, the results of the introduced framework are presented, discussed and conclusions for future steps are drawn. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

This paper describes a set of tools, called Team Tracks, designed to ease program comprehension by showing the source code navigation patterns of fellow development team members. One technique shows a list of related items, given that the user is viewing a given method or class. Another technique shows the favorite classes, by showing a class hierarchy view that hides less frequently visited classes, methods, and members. Two user studies, a laboratory study and a field study, were run to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques. The results of the two studies demonstrate that sharing navigation data can improve program comprehension and is subjectively preferred by users.},

We describe a 3-tiered architecture centering around the notion of a Common Music Runtime, a shared platform on top of which inter-operating client interfaces may be combined to form new musical instruments. This approach allows hardware devices such as the monome to act as an extended hardware interface with the same power to initiate and control musical processes as a bespoke programming language. Finally, we reflect on the structure of the collaborative project itself, which offers an opportunity to discuss general research strategy for conducting highly sophisticated technical research within a performing arts environment such as the development of a personal regime of preparation for performance.},
