Reference 1 - 0.31% Coverage
Confusing when vis changed
Reference 2 - 0.70% Coverage
I still did not feel they represented the code or music very well
Reference 3 - 0.52% Coverage
Doesn't seem to be linked with the code as much.
Reference 4 - 0.21% Coverage
didn't change much
Reference 5 - 0.23% Coverage
Visualisations - no
Reference 6 - 0.16% Coverage
Same as before
Reference 7 - 0.77% Coverage
No. Does the code influence visualisations? Influence is not clear.
Reference 8 - 0.66% Coverage
it didn't actually look random... too evenly distributed?
Reference 9 - 0.57% Coverage
Not really - seemed disconnected from performance
Reference 10 - 0.36% Coverage
The visualisations not so much.
Reference 11 - 0.64% Coverage
no. the visuals seemed to be timed? didn't seem to be live.
Reference 12 - 0.65% Coverage
Visualisations can *distract* from appreciation of code
Reference 13 - 0.43% Coverage
But the visualisation does not help :(
Reference 14 - 0.98% Coverage
to me the visualisations did not help communicate to me the fact that this was live coding
Reference 15 - 1.18% Coverage
Visualisations just felt like a 90s windows screensaver that changed w/ each addition to the performance
Reference 16 - 0.56% Coverage
But I did not grasp the meaning of visualisations,
Reference 17 - 0.54% Coverage
Some of the visualisation did not make much sense
Reference 18 - 0.33% Coverage
only made the code hard to read
Reference 19 - 0.20% Coverage
Not necessarily -
Reference 20 - 0.61% Coverage
the visualisations did nothing to suggest it was live.
Reference 21 - 0.24% Coverage
