Unsure how the visualizations related to music -> need to be intuitive

I found the three wavy live vis confusing - knowing what it was refering in the music (labels) would have been good.

It might be interesting to look at some of the literature on synaethesia for inspiration on this.

Second one was better but did not reflect rhythm too much.
Reference 5 - 0.93% Coverage
but they don't feel like they reflected what is playing well
Reference 6 - 1.27% Coverage
Movement of animations is synch with beats. Small beats -> small animations etc.
Reference 7 - 0.92% Coverage
Would be better for vis to relfect each element of the music
Reference 8 - 0.77% Coverage
maybe better if they relfect the mood of the music
Reference 9 - 2.54% Coverage
perhaps have a stronger correlations with hush tones -> defined shapes. Baselines -> wide and soft shapes... that animations follow the beat more consistently.
Reference 10 - 1.63% Coverage
The interaction between the sound and the visuals is interesting and could be pushed much more forward.
Reference 11 - 2.80% Coverage
It would have been better if the visualisation was more uniform in the last performance + more meaningful in terms of the beat + rhythm rather than the time it took for the code to run.
Reference 12 - 0.92% Coverage
visualisation changing size as the tempo went up and down.
Reference 13 - 1.21% Coverage
For the first one, the visualisation could be based on the melody of the music.
Reference 14 - 1.50% Coverage
One can also create a visualisation that shows the layer of the music. From base up to melody etc.
Reference 15 - 1.50% Coverage
Maybe it would be cool to keep them all up rather than taking them down or as an instrument enters.

Representation of pitch as well as volume?
