id,improvements1,You need separate screens... overlayed code and graphics was confusing. Unsure how the visualizations related to music -> need to be intuitive2,"If you must use the visuals, probably images with the instrument being played could help."3,"During the starting when the code was being written some part of music was monotonous. Too many use of ""random"" where music was off beat during first performance [2 didactic]. 2nd performance was good. [2 aesthetic]"4,I found the three wavy live vis confusing - knowing what it was refering in the music (labels) would have been good. I feel vis could be more complex - show more information. May be combine some (segmented circles?)5,See previous comments. It might be interesting to look at some of the literature on synaethesia for inspiration on this.6,Second set of visualisations looks prettier but less connected with code.7,"First one was factual but ""boring"". Second one was better but did not reflect rhythm too much."8,-9,I thought the first visualisation [2 didactic] methods was better and I have no comments on how to improve that method.10,Not really.11,no. but they don't feel like they reflected what is playing well the second was more enjoyable to watch. The first reflected the music more.12,Maybe have the code and visuals on different screens (if it were for a live performance that wasn't a user study). When all the instruments were playing it was difficult to see the code.13,-14,Movement of animations is synch with beats. Small beats -> small animations etc.15,16,Would be better for vis to relfect each element of the music - eg. Something for drums or chords etc. The 1st performance seemed to do this but the connection could have been stronger17,Being on a separate screen might help so they aren't competing with the code.18,"A surrounding projection would be better (though trickier to organise). Perhaps a more vivid variation when the code is updated, especially when adding or removing instruments."19,I prefer visuals that look nice rather than contain a lot of information - maybe better if they relfect the mood of the music rather than technical stuff?20,I was too busy focusing on the code & I didn't get so much of a connection between them & the music.21,"* could you ""live code"" the colour pallettes? To alter the visualisation moods? * soundwaves never grow old (in my mind) * perhaps have a stronger correlations with hush tones -> defined shapes. Baselines -> wide and soft shapes... that animations follow the beat more consistently. * It would be really cool once you edit a code line and then activate it / schedule for it to morph into a visualisation for as long as this line of code is active?"22,The interaction between the sound and the visuals is interesting and could be pushed much more forward.23,Make the visualisation of the second performance more fine-grained will help. It will be better not just relate the function to the sound but relate every beat to the sound or to the code responsible for that beat as well. Think about flashing s-exps rather than flashing HUD.24,"I found the visualizations distracting. The words in the second performance also obscured some lines of code. My understanding of this was just that you just demonstrated the code rather than having the visualisations as an aid. Also, the visualisations were not in beat with the music. This annoys me. Finally, some of the visusalisations I could not interpret, I knew what they were, I just couldn't map one-to-one the visualisations and the sound."25,Be more consistent. Last performance had some good elements but the labelling was unneccessary. It would have been better if the visualisation was more uniform in the last performance + more meaningful in terms of the beat + rhythm rather than the time it took for the code to run. In terms of visualisation it did show what code was running though in the 2nd performance.26,-27,"visualisation changing size as the tempo went up and down. Part 1 could use some vis from part 2, which had better vis. Having 2 separate screens could help because at times the vis was covering the code. Really brilliant idea. Good work!!"28,"For the first one, the visualisation could be based on the melody of the music. Especially the one with a large amount of squares. One can also create a visualisation that shows the layer of the music. From base up to melody etc. The second visualisation makes a bit more sense, but it's a bit boring in a sense. Feel the rest blocked too much code and made it difficult to see the code."29,"First performance: forgive me if I'm wrong but it seemed each distinct visualisation corresponded to an instrument. Maybe it would be cool to keep them all up rather than taking them down or as an instrument enters. (Then again, could make screen way too crowded) Second performance - maybe drop descriptive text after a while? Or fade it? Either way really liked 2nd performance."30,"While the first song was catchy, the second one was not as interesting and would bettter function as background music. Catchy music demands my attention (eyes included) - that's my __ [? unintelligible]"31, -Representation of pitch as well as volume? -For the first one including name of methods(?) with each new visualisation. -Segregating parts of the screen for different instruments/methods (more so for the first performance).32,"I really enjoyed the music, coding and visuals of the first set. Can't offer any advice for improvement - great job."33,Maintain visibility of code. Don't be overly stimulating visuallly.34,"The first ones were my fav. The second one w/ the drums was too 'flashing' but if it reflects the beat, it is hard to change. You could use coour + like pulses to reflect the beat?"35,-36,"Flashing images in the second performance were a bit hard to watch - ""stroke like"""37,The small speckly squares made reading the code hard -> some way to make them interfere less for reading would be good. Likewise the second performance was hard to read as well. Perhaps avoid the words (chords/base/bleeps)?38,Perhaps the code & the visualisations could be on separate screens? Then there is one screen for geeks & one for non-geeks :). Well done! I really enjoyed the performances.39,"With my limited knowledge of programming, I don't think I have a good suggestion. By the way, congratulation for greatful performance."40,-41,-
