Meeting 10 (9/05/2014)

Two Dimensional Model of Program Visualisation in the Domain of Music:
-Music vs Code and Concrete vs Abstract

Could be further extended to 'Two Dimensional Model of Program Visualisation':
-Domain vs Code and Concrete vs Abstract


Could ask questions such as:
-Do concrete or abstract visualisations improve the understanding of programming within specific domains?
-Does a visual representation close to the music increase enjoyment of the performance?
-Does a visual representation closer to the code assist in understanding the process?
-Where do the most effective visualisations in terms of understanding sit within the two dimensional model?
-Where do the most effective visualisations in terms of enjoyment sit within the two dimensional model?
-How does a combined abstract, concrete visualisation change the dynamic of the performance?

Visualisations:
-Some experiments. Not polished. Abstract....
-How limited should the visualsations be in order to get meaningful results?

Discuss Performance:
-one visualisation abstract, one visualisation concrete. Will this be enough to come to some sort of conclusion on the two dimensional model.
-pushing back date from 12 May to end of May.
-hard deadline for the mid-term seminar (16 June).
-ethics - read some of the statement, ethics approval.


Ideas Developing for the next performance:
-manipulation of the text for concrete
-more advanced abstract patterns



artistic vs informational
change two dimensional model to grid

aesthetic and didactic

working hypothesis: the visualsations help





Experiements
----------------
0 - informal
1 - Didactic vs aesthetic
2 - Combo DA
3 - Combo + overlay


Talk to henry's class
