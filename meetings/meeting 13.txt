Meeting 13

THESIS
-----------

Can the application of visualisations to code aid in the coordination of the mental model of the coder and audience thereby reducing the knowledge gap?

Why does the audience and the coder report such a different experience?

Alternatives:
-Can the application of visualisations to code aid in the experiential coordination of coder and observer thereby  

LIVENESS
---------------

We have already conducted a study investigating how an audience responds to what a live coder intends. perhaps investigate why there is such a large gap between what the live coder is interested in and what the external person observes ...

Eg. Ben had very little focus on anything but the code whereas the audience was mesmerised by everything but what the code was intended to do.

Visualisation as a tool for collaboration.


Interesting resource for liveness (Liveness - performance in a mediatized culture, phillip auslander)


STUDY
----------

Smaller user study to get more directed feedback.
Study with around 12 participants (user study or focus group)


VISUALISATION
----------------------

Visualisation prototype demo.

What was taken from the previous study/ interview?
-Immediacy for actions - taken from responses to previous study.
-Less intrusive visualisations - dedicating portions of the screen to the intrusive parts of the visualisation. 
-Avoiding the use of text.


INTERVIEW REPORT
------------------------------

Will have a full analysis of the interview with Ben by the end of the weekend.


NOTES
----------

Goals for the OzCHI short paper:
-build in drama
-live coding visualisations that investigate the drama of a live performance
