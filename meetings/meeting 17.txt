Captions should say ‘best viewed in colour’

Understanding should say ’self reported understanding’

performances should say ‘user study'

didactic - scheduling, metrononme, and text
aesthetic - calming, meditative, flowing, progression in the visualisations (!), avoid obscuring the text, 

design ideas were workshopped…
