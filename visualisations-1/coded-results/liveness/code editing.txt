Watching the program conveyed it as live
Reference 4 - 0.46% Coverage
In-interpreter changes were impressive

Reference 6 - 0.16% Coverage
code changing
Reference 7 - 0.54% Coverage
Code yes, especially when changing frequencies

Yes, the code change was more helpful in communicating that the performance was live
Reference 9 - 0.58% Coverage
appearance of code correlated with keyboard clicks
Reference 10 - 0.56% Coverage
When the artist changed the code the music changed
Reference 11 - 0.58% Coverage
Code showed what the musician was doing physically.
Reference 12 - 0.21% Coverage
Again the code did.
Reference 13 - 0.57% Coverage
yes - seeing the code change and hearing the result.
Reference 14 - 0.15% Coverage
The code yes.
Reference 15 - 0.32% Coverage
The code typed seem to be live
Reference 16 - 0.44% Coverage
you could see it was live from the typing
Reference 17 - 1.05% Coverage
The interpreter/composer took care to slow down the music in a way I could follow and perceive.
Reference 18 - 0.40% Coverage
Mostly the hesitation of the cursor
Reference 19 - 0.93% Coverage
The code conveys the message that the music is generated by live-modified LISP code
Reference 20 - 0.77% Coverage
Both of the code and the visualisation shows the performance is live.
Reference 21 - 0.66% Coverage
He was coding ""live"" in front of us so therefore it is live.
Reference 22 - 0.46% Coverage
code did -> could see then hear the changes
Reference 23 - 0.52% Coverage
Yes. Since I could see Ben coding on the screen.
Reference 24 - 0.94% Coverage
The code certainly showed that it was live - typing of code and submission of changes.
Reference 25 - 0.45% Coverage
seeing the code go up was a huge indicator
Reference 26 - 0.24% Coverage
Projected code: yes.
Reference 27 - 0.50% Coverage
Projected code did as we saw it going out live.
Reference 28 - 0.58% Coverage
The code was much more interesting and stimulating.
Reference 29 - 2.17% Coverage
Yes, you could see the connection between Ben's reactions/actions and the code changing (ie. Him typing), and the connection between the code changing and the music/visualisations changing.
Reference 30 - 0.27% Coverage
Code helped enormously
Reference 31 - 0.43% Coverage
I could see the coding affect the music
Reference 32 - 0.44% Coverage
Changes in variables within functions
Reference 33 - 0.32% Coverage
were linked to code changes.
Reference 34 - 0.23% Coverage
the code was edited.
Reference 35 - 0.40% Coverage
You could see the code being written
Reference 36 - 0.76% Coverage
Yes. Changing of code that changed the music made it clear it was live
Reference 37 - 0.78% Coverage
Yes. Dynamic nature and change clearly in response to Ben's commands.
Reference 38 - 0.65% Coverage
Seeing the code was great & definitely made it feel 'live'.
Reference 39 - 0.76% Coverage
I was mainly focussed on reading the code so didn't notice them much.
Reference 40 - 0.78% Coverage
code also represent the name of instrument while the music was played.
Reference 41 - 1.16% Coverage
Yes. I think so. It is because of the code used is so connected with the sound of instruments that are used.
Reference 42 - 0.64% Coverage
Yes, because musician (programmer) is changing the code
Reference 43 - 1.45% Coverage
Yes. You can see the feedback and how timing variables were changed according to Ben's feedback (how he gauged what he was hearing)
