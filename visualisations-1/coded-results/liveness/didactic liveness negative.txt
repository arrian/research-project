Internals\\liveness - § 26 references coded [ 16.78% Coverage]
Reference 1 - 0.46% Coverage
Probably not because I had the context set
Reference 2 - 1.01% Coverage
I guess we're used to auto-visualisations of music so that didn't contribute quite as much
Reference 3 - 1.09% Coverage
Also I didn't feel the visualisations were very representitive of what was happening musically.
Reference 4 - 0.27% Coverage
visualisations did not
Reference 5 - 0.82% Coverage
Visualisations not so much - vis are cool but not clear what they represent
Reference 6 - 0.54% Coverage
No. visualisations need to be clearer in the code
Reference 7 - 0.11% Coverage
in sync??
Reference 8 - 0.62% Coverage
The visualisations were interesting but distracting.
Reference 9 - 0.69% Coverage
May be better having a second projection for visualisations.
Reference 10 - 0.04% Coverage
no.
Reference 11 - 0.57% Coverage
the visuals only responded to what was being typed.
Reference 12 - 0.89% Coverage
transitions between ""musical forms"" didn't occur at the most expected times
Reference 13 - 0.53% Coverage
More could be done giving interesting results.
Reference 14 - 0.74% Coverage
viualisations were a bit all over the shop + not all that meaningful
Reference 15 - 0.68% Coverage
not very interesting or meaningful for chords, bleeps + base
Reference 16 - 0.93% Coverage
Also the [circle in circle] aren't appear in time neither the [backtick in circle].
Reference 17 - 0.88% Coverage
Generally took away from the code + not a good visualisation of what is going on.
Reference 18 - 0.31% Coverage
Visualisations not so much
Reference 19 - 0.50% Coverage
perhaps made performance seem too polished.
Reference 20 - 0.43% Coverage
This taking away fom live aspect of it.
Reference 21 - 0.65% Coverage
I found the projected visualisation a little simplistic.
Reference 22 - 0.48% Coverage
The graphics were distracting in this set.
Reference 23 - 0.41% Coverage
It felt harder to understand the code
Reference 24 - 1.74% Coverage
The visualisations for this performance were overly distracting from the experience and thereby detracted from the notion that it was a live performance.
Reference 25 - 0.73% Coverage
The visualisations distracted from the code + because the focus.
Reference 26 - 0.65% Coverage
I found them distracting & preferred just to read the code.
