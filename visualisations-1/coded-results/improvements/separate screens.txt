Internals\\improvements - § 8 references coded [ 8.91% Coverage]
Reference 1 - 1.16% Coverage
You need separate screens... overlayed code and graphics was confusing.
Reference 2 - 0.82% Coverage
Maybe have the code and visuals on different screens
Reference 3 - 1.20% Coverage
Being on a separate screen might help so they aren't competing with the code.
Reference 4 - 1.16% Coverage
A surrounding projection would be better (though trickier to organise).
Reference 5 - 1.08% Coverage
The words in the second performance also obscured some lines of code.
Reference 6 - 1.31% Coverage
Having 2 separate screens could help because at times the vis was covering the code.
Reference 7 - 1.12% Coverage
Feel the rest blocked too much code and made it difficult to see the code.
Reference 8 - 1.07% Coverage
Perhaps the code & the visualisations could be on separate screens?
