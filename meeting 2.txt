Research Project - Meeting 2 - 24 February 2014

Reason for the Visualisations
-authenticity - shows that there is responsiveness
	-many levels of authenticity
-authenticity vs understanding

-expressiveness - show phase within the musical piece

-perceived difficulty vs 
-directness
-direct action vs authenticity


-knowing when things go wrong
-errors within live coding should be presented to the audience

-logging in extempore

Process of Exploration
understand, model, further understanding

Performances
-art not apart - ben and torb
-you are here - ben, 9pm at the city
-cssa performance - ben and andrew


-objective vs subjective

-complementary artistic visualisation

Action Items

-Levels of Taxonomy
	-types of visualisations
		-visualisations based on intent
		-placement on the display
		-visualisations that responded to music
		-typing visualisations that respond to typing
		-infographics augmenting the code
		-passive vs active visualisations for understanding
-Survey audience
	-open ended
	-closed ended - set of questions
		-have you ever seen live coding performance before
		-audience participation through the live coding performance (ask the audience to rate their engagement across a variety of dimensions by selecting a curve that best represents the specific dimension)
			-interest (curve)
			-understanding
			-enjoyment
			-curiosity
			-admiration
			-authenticity
		-what aspects of the projection of the code did you find confusing?
		-did the visualisation distract or complement the performance?
		-what do you think the visualisation achieved
-Project plan
-Timeline
-Reading summary
-Design ideas (how we will visualise the code)
-Presentation for next week
