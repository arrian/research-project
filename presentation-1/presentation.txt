Research Project - Presentation

WHAT WILL I BE DOING THIS YEAR
-investigating code understanding and comprehension through the use of visualisations
-target audience not necessarily just programmers
-will be investigating visualisations of code targeted at public audiences
-to achieve this, I need a space in which code is common and the audience for the code is not just programmers
-live coding fits the specification 

DEFINE TERMS
-live coding definition
	-what it is?
		-performance
		-musical
		-show the audience the code
	-….show example….
-audience participation and involvement
	-authenticity vs understanding

DEFINE PROBLEM
-what is the problem within live coding?
	-visualisations are often abstract
	-do not represent the programmers intent
	-audience often cannot comprehend the authors intent
-furthermore, there has been little movement towards formal analysis within the area 

WHY DO I CARE?
-application to the wider field of software engineering
-why, as a software engineer, does live coding matter?
-presents code to audience’s who have little previous exposure
-code comprehension has huge impacts on software engineering practice
-developing an approach to live coding that provides context through visualisations could inform further development within software engineering practice

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?
-The study would approach the issue from two angles. 
-live coding from the audience's perspective to gain insight into how to design visualisations to support their existing mental model
-examining live coding from the artist's perspective, gaining insight into what the artist wants to convey and the best method to approach this.
-project plan?
	1. investigate existing mental models within both the audience and programmer (eg. survey). 
		-in the process now of preparing surveys
	2. develop and test visualisations informed by lit review and survey
	3. test the newly developed visualisations
		-plan is to develop visualisations, run a study within a controlled setting
	4. analyse the results of the study and build on the results to develop a refined set of visualisations
-move the field towards formal analysis
