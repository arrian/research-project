Meeting 


Two Dimensional Model of Program Visualisation in the Domain of Music:
-Music vs Code and Concrete vs Abstract


Could be further extended to 'Two Dimensional Model of Program Visualisation':
-Domain vs Code and Concrete vs Abstract


Could ask questions such as:
-Do concrete or abstract visualisations improve the understanding of programming within specific domains?
-Does a visual representation close to the music increase enjoyment of the performance?
-Does a visual representation closer to the code improve understanding?
-Where do the most effective visualisations in terms of understanding sit within the two dimensional model?
-Where do the most effective visualisations in terms of enjoyment sit within the two dimensional model?

Visualisations:
-Some experiments. Not polished. Abstract.

Discuss Performance:
-one visualisation abstract, one visualisation concrete
-pushing back date from 12 May to end of May
-hard deadline for the mid-term seminar (16 June)
-ethics - read some of the statement, ethics approval
