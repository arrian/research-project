% -----
% The Early History of Software Visualization (Baecker, Ronald chapter of book) discusses the purpose of software visualisation as enhancing program representation, presentation and appearance. Discusses further that programmers have always used visualisation tools (eg. diagrams) to aid in illustrating program function, structure and process. States further that any of typography, symbols, images, diagrams and animation can present information more concisely than formal/natural programming languages. 

% The Early History of Software Visualisation (Baecker) gives the major \'threads\' of activity in the development of software visualsation as (1) the presentation of source code, (2) representation of data structures, (3) animation of program behaviour and (4) systems for software visualisation and (5) animation of concurrency.
% ---------

% Exposing the Programming Process discusses the focus of visualsations on the execution of the program rather than the development of the program.

% Found demonstrating the following concepts useful for teaching programming:
% - use of an IDE
% - incremental development
% - testing
% - refactoring
% - error handling
% - use of online documentation
% - model-based programming

% ---------
% Seven Basic Principles of Software Engineering (Boehm, 1983) discusses the following principles:
% (1) manage using a phased life-cycle plan
% (2) perform continuous validation
% (3) maintain disciplined product control
% (4) use modern programming practices
% (5) maintain clear accountability for results
% (6) use better and fewer people
% (7) maintain a commitment to improve the process

% -"A person understands a program when he is able to explain the program, its structure, its behavior, its effects on its operational context, and its relationships to its application domain in terms that are qualitatively different from the tokens used to construct the source code of the program." - Program Understanding...

% -------------

% Toward a Perceptual Science of Multidimensional Data Visualization: Bertin and Beyond discusses that info visualisations can be constructed by mapping one data dimension to brightness, colors or orientations, however, it goes on to say that in practice this does not work very well. \"Humans can only perceive a limited number of data dimensions\".

% Discusses fundamental graphic primitives/procedures as invariants, components, correspondences and marks. Components define variational concepts. Invariants relate components. Marks (three types/ \"implantations\" incl. point, line and area) are graphical representations on the visualisation that represent invariants. Correspondences are the relationships between and among components.

% Discusses that there are two \"Functionally different classes of visual variable\" including planar and retinal variables. Planar includes any spatial information and retinal variables include things such as size, color, shape, orientation, texture and brightness (which can use marks to be displayed).

% (Check source) Bertin states that it is only possible to effectively map three graphic variables including two planar dimensions and one retinal dimension.

% Bertin also did not discuss motion within his variables. Investigation of this in the context of temporal visualisation would be enlightening.

% \section{The Role of the Programmer}







% ----------------------------------------------------

% \subsection{Taxonomy}


% -Goal: categorising existing visualisations
% -Gaps in existing models: elaboration of dynamic software visualisation taxonomies, taxonomy of music visualisation

% -High level features:
% 	-Shape
% 	-Size
% 	-Orientation
% 	-Dimensionality
% 	-Colour
% -‘Rethinking Visualisation: A High Level Taxonomy' discusses lower level taxonomy including - spacial relationships, numeric trends, patterns, connectivity and filtering

% -distinction between scientific visualisation and information visualisation (Infovis discussed in Rethinking Visualization: A High-Level Taxonomy)
% -Information visualisation vs Scientific visualisation - “infovis when spacial representation is chosen, scivis when spacial representation is given”
% -Taxonomy developed within this article consists of {discrete, continuous} vs display attributes (eg. given, constrained, chosen) per the design model
% -Discussed in A Principled Taxonomy of Software Visualisation (1993)
% -Myers (1986) classifies using level of abstraction vs level of animation. (Visual Programming, Programming by Example… A Taxonomy) Also uses {static, dynamic} vs {code, data}. Minimal discussion of dynamic visualisations; no elaboration.

% -Most effective visualisation technique might be \"Self-illustrating phenomena\" \\

% Both code and music present a wide variety of visualisation techniques. These techniques will be summarised below.


% \subsubsection{Code Visualisation}

% % \paragraph{Code Augmentation}
% Visuals based on Code Augmentation (eg. infographics, annotations, sparklines)\\
% Visuals based on Code Augmentation
% -infographics
% -annotations (visual code annotations for cyberphysical programming)
% -sparklines (Visual Monitoring of Numeric Variables Embedded in Source Code)
% -etc

% % \paragraph{Code Abstraction}
% Visuals based on Abstraction (eg. scheme bricks, gource, code flow)\\

% Visuals based on Abstraction
% -scheme bricks
% -gource
% -code flow
% -etc
% % \paragraph{Software Domain Visualisations}
% Domain Visualisations (eg. fluid source code views, indentation, class diagrams)\\

% Domain Visualisations
% -understood by the domain, not necessarily useful for observers
% -eg. eclipse, visual studio code displays, auto updating class diagrams etc
% -fluid source code views (Fluid Source Code Views for Just In-Time Comprehension)
% -class diagrams
% -debugging
% -tracing

% \subsubsection{Music Visualisation}
% -music is similar to software in a number of ways
% -often has standardised notation
% -expression may diverge from notation
% -visual representation is by default static
% -can be visualised using dynamic methods
% -understanding can augmented with visualisation techniques

% % \paragraph{Generative Visualisations}
% Generative Visualisations (eg. frequency wave, VLC/iTunes visualisations)\\

% Generative Visualisations
% -\"generates animated imagery based on a piece of music\"
% -eg. change with loudness and frequency spectrum
% -VLC, iTunes etc.
% -visualisations that respond to music

% % \paragraph{Associative or Emotive Visualisations}
% Associative or Emotive Visualisations (eg. video art, sampled video)\\

% Associative or Emotive Visualisations
% -includes areas such as synaesthesia (Movies from Music)
% -eg. video art, sampled video with sampled music
% -extension/exploration of Emotion-based Music Visualisation using Photos
% -Classifications including: sublime, sad, touching, easy, light, happy, exciting, grand


% % \paragraph{Music Domain Visualisations}
% Domain Visualisations (eg. ableton, sheet music)\\

% Domain Visualisations
% -understood by the domain, not necessarily useful for observers (A Visualisation of Music)
% -could include music creation tools, for example abelton etc.
% -graphic representations that have one-to-one mapping
% -direct visualisation
% -eg. sheet music (again, A Visualisation of Music)

% \subsubsection{Methodology Visualisation}


% \subsection{Design}

% -NOTE: make it clear that this is not intended to be a visual programming language environment. The intention of this project is to assist in code comprehension 

% \subsubsection{Cognitive Dimensions of Notation}
% $http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dimensions$

% \subsubsection{Visual Primitives}

% structural units include line, shape, color, form, motion, texture, pattern, direction, orientation, scale, angle, space and proportion.

% deutsch limit (max 50 visual elements onscreen)

% \subsubsection{Mapping Methodology}



% --------------------------
% \subsection{Live Coding}

% -live coding is a platform for bridging these two domain visualisations 
% -what is live coding?
% -method of programming in front of an audience for artistic or informative purposes
% -the live coder displays their screen to an audience, showing their code as they are working on it building a functional program
% -makes use of interactive programming environments 
% -program running while changes are being made 
% -often focusses on improvisation - the programmer often has to think on their feet

% -what does live coding achieve?
% -gives the audience insight into the programming process - i’ll be taking advantage of this
