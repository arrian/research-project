abstract = {Software visualization is the use of interactive computer
graphics, typography, graphic design, animation, and cinematography to
enhance the interface between the software engineer or the computer
science student and their programs. Although several taxonomies of
software visualization have been proposed, they use few dimensions and
do not span the space of important distinctions between systems. The
authors propose a novel and systematic taxonomy of six areas making up
thirty characteristic features of software visualization technology. The
taxonomy is presented and illustrated in terms of its application to
seven systems of historic importance and technical interest},

This includes natural language parsing techniques, using geometrical properties of space in language semantics, representation of execution flow in live coding environments, code as visual data and computer games as live coding environments. We will also touch on the unifying perceptual basis behind symbols, graphics, movement and sound.},
