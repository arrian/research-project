# Presentation Requirements 

## Damien's Notes

- Plan carefully what you're going to say
- Should be approximately 20 slides, including a Title Slide and an outline of the talk
- We should be explaining what we've done in the past several months. Specifically, what work's happened between the start of the year an now
- You will want to present any results that you have.
- Be conscious of timing
- Remember that you are pitching to the audience. It's a form of communication. Think about the people in your field, and what you want them to get out of this presentation, what do you want them to know.
- Be sure to know what your key points are.
- Avoid writing a speech out in full and reading it.
- Remember it's about taking the audience from where they are to where you want them to be.
- People want to see enthusiasm about our work.
- Above all, remind us what the project is and why it's interesting.

## John Slaney's Requirements
Your talk should remind us all of what your project is, and why it's interesting, and then focus on progress of your project to date and any preliminary results you may have. Any plan you may have for finishing it in the remaining time should also get a mention.
