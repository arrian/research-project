#Presentation Requirements (Damien's notes)

- Plan carefully what you're going to say
- Should be approximately 20 slides, including a Title Slide and an outline of the talk
- We should be explaining what we've done in the past several months. Specifically, what work's happened between the start of the year an now
- You will want to present any results that you have.
- Be conscious of timing
- Remember that you are pitching to the audience. It's a form of communication. Think about the people in your field, and what you want them to get out of this presentation, what do you want them to know.
- Be sure to know what your key points are.
- Avoid writing a speech out in full and reading it.
- Remember it's about taking the audience from where they are to where you want them to be.
- People want to see enthusiasm about our work.
- Above all, remind us what the project is and why it's interesting.
