\section{Live Coding}
\label{sec:livecoding}

(focus on developing a narrative concerning what needs to be done within live coding to achieve the software engineering goals and what needs to be done to develop successful visualisations within the field of live coding)
\\\\
Live coding describes the process of exposing the programming process to a live audience. -talk more about what live coding is
\\\\
Live coding history... . -talk more about history of live coding
\\\\
There exists much discussion within the live coding research body (eg. ...) about the potential for live visual manipulation and examination of the current progress within the field to achieve this.
