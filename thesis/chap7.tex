\chapter{Summary}
\label{chap:summary}

Statements examined throughout the thesis {\color{red} state there validity here}:
-there is a need for increased audience understanding within live coding
-there is a need for increased audience enjoyment within live coding
-there is a need for increased live coder understanding within live coding
-there is a need for increased live coder enjoyment within live coding
-there is a measurable effect on enjoyment with the visualisations compared to without
-there is a measurable effect on understanding with the visualisations compared to without

-visualisations have a place in live coding
-visualisations have a place in understanding the coding process
-visualisations can communicate the coding process more effectively than without
-visualisations have a place in understanding code structures

\section{Contributions}

Updated software visualisation taxonomy built on the existing software visualisation frameworks...

Method of evaluating software visualisation...

Method of developing process driven software visualisation for live coding...

Process-driven software visualisation showing software as it is being developed (live, as in live-coding)...

Evaluation of a process-driven software visualisation...

Contribution to live coding process and outcome... A multi-disciplinary approach, implementation and evaluation of a software application.

Discuss recommendations?...

``...methodological issues have to be studied further. This concerns questions like how to design visualizations and how to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of various solutions.''~\cite{VanWijk2005} A methodology for visualisation design has been developed.

Application of a software engineering design process in collaboration with an artist.

\section{Limitations}

-type of language may affect understanding. Imperitive vs functional etc.

-how wide can the results of this study be generalised outside of the field of live coding.

\section{Future Work}

Aesthetic elements of the software...

Didactic elements of the software...

Future of visualisations in live coding...

Application to software engineering practice...

Application to the arts...

Visualisation as a means to communicate the coding process...

Visualisation as a means to more effective coding...
