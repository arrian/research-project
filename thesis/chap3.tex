\chapter{Visualisation Design}
\label{chap:visualisation-design}

Following the field study (see Chapter~\ref{chap:exploratory-field-study}), a strategy for visualisation prototyping and evaluation was developed. The field study indicated a need for The reason for developing visualisations, this process and the resulting software prototype are outlined in this chapter.

\section{Rationale}

Evaluation of the literature identified the need for visualisations to be developed to help live coding audiences understand and enjoy the live coding performance.


\section{Requirements}

In order to systematically and efficiently develop a visualisation design strategy, two stakeholders were identified.

The audience was the intended audience and was identified as a critical stakeholder in the ultimate effectiveness of the visualisations developed. The audience evaluated in the initial field study would provide

\section{Design}

The design of the initial visualsations focussed on the application of the literature on visualisation design to the field of software visualisation and the application to the visualisation of live code.

Visualisations developed employed dynamic analysis of the running code to generate the visuals. The intended knowledge flow from programmer to observer is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:knowledge-flow-initial}.

Music visualisation is an extremely rich and open-ended task, so to guide the development of the visualisations for our lab study, we used the concepts of understanding and enjoyment from the initial survey to develop two new code visualisations: a \emph{didactic} one and an \emph{aesthetic} one. 

\subsection{Didactic Visualisation}
\label{sec:didactic-visualisation}

The didactic visualisation (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:didactic-visualisation}) attempted to communicate \emph{information} about the actions of the programmer, prominently displaying the \emph{names} of the active (source code) functions and the ``time until next execution'' for each function (which is particularly relevant in a time-sensitive programming context such as music making). Bright colours and solid shapes were used to ensure constant visibility and to communicate the intention of the underlying code. The didactic visualisations proceeded through four stages, with phase changes made depending on the number of active functions (instruments).

\subsection{Aesthetic Visualisation}
\label{sec:aesthetic-visualisation}

The aesthetic visualisation technique was designed to react to the programmer's activity in a more abstract way, to maximise aesthetic appeal~\cite{Cawthon2007} and to engage the audience's interest. Although still based on the source code and the livecoder's edits, the generation of shapes was driven by instrument volume and synchronised with the musical beat. The emphasis for the aesthetic visualisation was on the artistic appeal of the visuals (see Figure~\ref{fig:aesthetic-visualisation}), including more variety in visual structure and colour. As in the didactic condition, the aesthetic visualisations proceeded through four stages, based on the number of active functions (instruments), but these visuals had no textual labels and they moved and interacted with each other over the entire projected scene.
