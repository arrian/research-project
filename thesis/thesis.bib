abstract = {This paper introduces Improcess, a novel cross-disciplinary collaborative project focussed on the design and development of tools to structure the communication between performer and musical process. We describe a 3-tiered architecture centering around the notion of a Common Music Runtime, a shared platform on top of which inter-operating client interfaces may be combined to form new musical instruments. This approach allows hardware devices such as the monome to act as an extended hardware interface with the same power to initiate and control musical processes as a bespoke programming language. Finally, we reflect on the structure of the collaborative project itself, which offers an opportunity to discuss general research strategy for conducting highly sophisticated technical research within a performing arts environment such as the development of a personal regime of preparation for performance.},

abstract = {The number of university undergraduate courses in the area of interactive media is increasing. Many of these courses are based in the schools of art and design that have traditionally valued and focused on developing the aesthetic and artistic design skills of their students. However, because of the rapid changes in new technology the relation between the technology and design has become complex. This poses new challenges for the educators in this field. The main challenge is defining the role of programming in the curriculum and the relationship between ‘coding’ skills and ‘design’ skills. The article examines different conceptual models of programming and suggests that the concept of programming as artistic and creative practice and ‘programming as design’ would be more suitable for the art and design curriculum.},

One solution to the collocation problem may lie with tools that facilitate distributed collaboration. This paper presents RIPPLE (Remote Interactive Pair Programming and Learning Environment), a development environment for distributed synchronous collaborative programming. RIPPLE is an open source software tool. Initial user tests demonstrate positive responses from students, and the potential for long term learning, motivation, and retention benefits is significant. In addition to its benefits for students, RIPPLE is a tool for computing education researchers who wish to collect data on collaborative programming.},

abstract = {All music performances are generative to the extent that the actions of performers produce musical sounds, but in this article the authors focus on performative interaction with generative music in a more compositional sense. In particular they discuss how live coding of music involves the building and management of generative processes. They suggest that the human interaction with generative processes that occurs in live coding provides a unique perspective on the generative music landscape. Especially significant is the way in which generative algorithms are represented in code to best afford interaction and modification during performance. They also discuss the features of generative processes that make them more or less suitable for live coding performances. They situate live coding practice within historical and theoretical contexts and ground the discussion with regular reference to their experiences performing in the live coding duo aa-cell.},

abstract = {Music players for personal computers are often featured with music visualization by generating animated patterns according to the music’s low-level features such as loudness and spectrum. This paper proposes an emotion-based music player which synchronizes visualization (photos) with music based on the emotions evoked by auditory stimulus of music and visual content of visualization. For emotion detection from photos, we collected 398 photos with their emotions annotated by 496 users through the web. With these annotations, a Bayesian classification method is proposed for automatic photo emotion detection. For emotion detection from music, we adopt an existing method. Finally, for composition of music and photos, in addition to matching high-level emotions, we also consider low-level feature harmony and temporal visual coherence. It is formulated as an optimization problem and solved by a greedy algorithm. Subjective evaluation shows emotion-based music visualization enriches users’ listening experiences.},

Most of these applications engage end-users or experts to tag multimedia objects with mood annotations. Within the scientific community different approaches for content-based music, photo or multimodal mood classification can be found with a wide range of used mood definitions or models and completely different test suites. The purpose of this paper is to review common mood models in order to assess their exibility, to present a generic multi-modal mood classification framework which uses various audio-visual features and multiple classifiers and to present a novel music and photo mood classification reference set for evaluation. The classification framework is the basis for different applications e.g. automatic media tagging or music slideshow players. The novel reference set can be used for comparison of different algorithms from various research groups. Finally, the results of the introduced framework are presented, discussed and conclusions for future steps are drawn. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

@article{Heer2006,
abstract = {Despite a diversity of software architectures supporting information visualization, it is often difficult to identify, evaluate, and re-apply the design solutions implemented within such frameworks. One popular and effective approach for addressing such difficulties is to capture successful solutions in design patterns, abstract descriptions of interacting software components that can be customized to solve design problems within a particular context. Based upon a review of existing frameworks and our own experiences building visualization software, we present a series of design patterns for the domain of information visualization. We discuss the structure, context of use, and interrelations of patterns spanning data representation, graphics, and interaction. By representing design knowledge in a reusable form, these patterns can be used to facilitate software design, implementation, and evaluation, and improve developer education and communication.},

Upper- and lower-division computer science and software engineering students were asked to respond to questions regarding the structure and execution of one source code module of a public domain graphics library. The time taken for each response and the correctness of each response was recorded. Statistical analysis of the data collected from these two experiments revealed that the CSD was highly significant in enhancing the subjects' performance in this program comprehension task. The results of these initial experiments promise to shed light on fundamental questions regarding the effect of software visualizations on program comprehensibility},

Towards this end we introduce Tidal, a pattern lan- guage designed for music improvisation, and embedded in the Haskell programming language. Tidal represents polyphonic patterns as a time varying function, providing an extensible range of pattern genera- tors and combinators for composing patterns out of hier- archies of sub-patterns. Open Sound Control (OSC) mes- sages are used to trigger sound events, where each OSC parameter may be expressed as a pattern. Tidal is designed to allow patterns to be created and modified during a live coded performance, aided by terse, expressive syntax and integration with an emerging time synchronisation stan- dard. 1.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on Mixed Reality (MR) visual displays, a particular subset of Virtual Reality (VR) related technologies that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds somewhere along the "virtuality continuum" which connects completely real environments to completely virtual ones. Probably the best known of these is Augmented Reality (AR), which refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However, an attempt to distinguish these classes on the basis of whether they are primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the real world is viewed directly or via some electronic display medium, whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the world or on the outside looking in, and whether or not the scale of the display is intended to map orthoscopically onto the real world leads to quite different groupings among the six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. The 'obvious' distinction between the terms "real" and "virtual" is shown to have a number of different aspects, depending on whether one is dealing with real or virtual objects, real or virtual images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these. An (approximately) three dimensional taxonomy is proposed, comprising the following dimensions: Extent of World Knowledge ("how much do we know about the world being displayed?"), Reproduction Fidelity ("how 'realistically' are we able to display it?"), and Extent of Presence Metaphor ("what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present within that world?"). key words: virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR)},

@article{Prangsma2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: History learning requires that students understand historical phenomena, abstract concepts and the relations between them. Students have problems grasping, using and relating complex historical developments and structures.

AIMS: A study was conducted to determine the effects of tasks with abstract and/or concrete visualizations on the learning of historical developments and structures. The hypothesis was that students receiving visualizations would learn and retain more historical knowledge and concepts than those not receiving visualizations.

SAMPLE: First-year pupils in vocational middle school (N=104) worked in randomly assigned pairs.

METHODS: After reading a text, the pairs were given a learning task in one of four conditions: Textual, Concrete visualized, Abstract visualized, and Combined.

RESULTS: Post-test and retention test results showed no significant differences. There were some significant differences on the evaluation questionnaire.

CONCLUSIONS: Combining text and different types of visualizations in learning tasks does not necessarily enhance history learning. Possible explanations given are the ecological setting, the semiotics of the domain of history--that are not defined clearly--and the difficulty of unequivocally visualizing historical concepts.},

@article{Robillard2007,
abstract = {A software modification task often addresses several concerns. A concern is anything a stakeholder may want to consider as a conceptual unit, including features, nonfunctional requirements, and design idioms. In many cases, the source code implementing a concern is not encapsulated in a single programming language module, and is instead scattered and tangled throughout a system. Inadequate separation of concerns increases the difficulty of evolving software in a correct and cost-effective manner. To make it easier to modify concerns that are not well modularized, we propose an approach in which the implementation of concerns is documented in artifacts, called concern graphs. Concern graphs are abstract models that describe which parts of the source code are relevant to different concerns. We present a formal model for concern graphs and the tool support we developed to enable software developers to create and use concern graphs during software evolution tasks. We report on five empirical studies, providing evidence that concern graphs support views and operations that facilitate the task of modifying the code implementing scattered concerns, are cost-effective to create and use, and robust enough to be used with different versions of a software system.},

abstract = {In this study, we addressed how the particular context of stimulus congruency influences audiovisual interactions. We combined an audiovisual congruency task with a proportion-of-congruency manipulation. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that the perceived duration of a visual stimulus is modulated by the actual duration of a synchronously presented auditory stimulus. In the following experiments, we demonstrated that this crossmodal congruency effect is modulated by the proportion of congruent trials between (Exp. 2) and within (Exp. 4) blocks. In particular, the crossmodal congruency effect was reduced in the context with a high proportion of incongruent trials. This effect was attributed to changes in participants' control set as a function of the congruency context, with greater control applied in the context where the majority of the trials were incongruent. These data contribute to the ongoing debate concerning crossmodal interactions and attentional processes. In sum, context can provide a powerful cue for selective attention to modulate the interaction between stimuli from different sensory modalities.},

The latter offers the freedom of concurrent editing (which may be helpful or damaging) and has even more awareness deficits than screen sharing. Objective: Characterize how competent distributed pair programmers may handle this additional freedom and these additional awareness deficits and characterize the impacts on the pair programming process. Method: A revelatory case study, based on direct observation of a single, highly competent distributed pair of industrial software developers during a 3-day collaboration. We use recordings of these sessions and conceptualize the phenomena seen. Results: 1. Skilled pairs may bridge the awareness deficits without visible obstruction of the overall process. 2. Skilled pairs may use the additional editing freedom in a useful limited fashion, resulting in potentially better fluency of the process than local pair programming. Conclusion: When applied skillfully in an appropriate context, distributed-pair programming can (not will!) work at least as well as local pair programming.},

abstract = {We present the novel high-level visualization taxonomy. Our taxonomy classifies visualization algorithms rather than data. Algorithms are categorized based on the assumptions they make about the data being visualized; we call this set of assumptions the design model. Because our taxonomy is based on design models, it is more flexible than existing taxonomies and considers the user's conceptual model, emphasizing the human aspect of visualization. Design models are classified according to whether they are discrete or continuous and by how much the algorithm designer chooses display attributes such as spatialization, timing, colour, and transparency. This novel approach provides an alternative view of the visualization field that helps explain how traditional divisions (e.g., information and scientific visualization) relates and overlap, and that may inspire research ideas in hybrid visualization areas},

Current taxonomies of visualization techniques are problematic because the terminology is vague. We present a new taxonomy based on models of a data set rather than attributes of the data itself. This method addresses several problems with existing classification schemes and generates less ambiguous visualization categories.},

@article{Ward2002,
abstract = {Glyphs (also referred to as icons) are graphical entities that convey one or more data values via attributes such as shape, size, color, and position. They have been widely used in the visualization of data and information, and are especially well suited for displaying complex, multivariate data sets. The placement or layout of glyphs on a display can communicate significant information regarding the data values themselves as well as relationships between data points, and a wide assortment of placement strategies have been developed to date. Methods range from simply using data dimensions as positional attributes to basing placement on implicit or explicit structure within the data set. This paper presents an overview of multivariate glyphs, a list of issues regarding the layout of glyphs, and a comprehensive taxonomy of placement strategies to assist the visualization designer in selecting the technique most suitable to his or her data and task. Examples, strengths, weaknesses, and design considerations are given for each category of technique. We conclude with some general guidelines for selecting a placement strategy, along with a brief description of some of our future research directions.},
