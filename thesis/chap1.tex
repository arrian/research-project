The Programming Language as a Musical Instrument
\begin{itemize}
\item Discusses differences between software engineering and live coding as a musical practice

\end{itemize}

Rethinking Visualization: A High-Level Taxonomy
\begin{itemize}
\item Old method of categorisation: Scientific vs Information (incl. factors such as scientific vs non\item scientific, physical vs abstract, spacialisation given vs specialisation chosen)
\item Introduce \'model based\' visualisation techniques
\item “our main objective is to provide insight into how different research areas relate, not to provide guidelines for visualisation design."
\item Terminology - Object of study, Data, Design model, User model (see image in article for relationship)
\item Taxonomy developed within this article consists of {discrete, continuous} vs display attributes (eg. given, constrained, chosen) per the design model
\item Continuous model visualisation is broken down according to the number if independent and dependent variables and the type of the dependent variables (incl. scale, vector and tensor)
\item Discrete model visualisations are broken down into wether the data structure or data values are visualised

\item Article discusses lower level taxonomy including - spacial relationships, numeric trends, patterns, connectivity, filtering
\end{itemize}

Heuristics for Information Visualization Evaluation
\begin{itemize}
\item suggests that between 3 and 5 heuristics for evaluation would be enough
\end{itemize}

\section{Live Coding}
\label{sec:livecoding}

(focus on developing a narrative concerning what needs to be done within live coding to achieve the software engineering goals and what needs to be done to develop successful visualisations within the field of live coding)
\\\\
Live coding describes the process of exposing the programming process to a live audience. -talk more about what live coding is
\\\\
Live coding history... . -talk more about history of live coding

The Early History of Software Visualization (Baecker, Ronald chapter of book) discusses the purpose of software visualisation as enhancing program representation, presentation and appearance. Discusses further that programmers have always used visualisation tools (eg. diagrams) to aid in illustrating program function, structure and process. States further that any of typography, symbols, images, diagrams and animation can present information more concisely than formal/natural programming languages. 

The Early History of Software Visualisation (Baecker) gives the major \'threads\' of activity in the development of software visualsation as (1) the presentation of source code, (2) representation of data structures, (3) animation of program behaviour and (4) systems for software visualisation and (5) animation of concurrency.
---------

Exposing the Programming Process discusses the focus of visualsations on the execution of the program rather than the development of the program.

Found demonstrating the following concepts useful for teaching programming:
- use of an IDE
- incremental development
- testing
- refactoring
- error handling
- use of online documentation
- model-based programming

---------
Seven Basic Principles of Software Engineering (Boehm, 1983) discusses the following principles:
(1) manage using a phased life-cycle plan
(2) perform continuous validation
(3) maintain disciplined product control
(4) use modern programming practices
(5) maintain clear accountability for results
(6) use better and fewer people
(7) maintain a commitement to improve the process

-"A person understands a program because he is able to relate the structures of the program and its environment to his conceptual knowledge about the world." - Program Understanding and the Concept Assignment Problem, Biggerstaff et al

-"A person understands a program when he is able to explain the program, its structure, its behavior, its effects on its operational context, and its relationships to its application domain in terms that are qualitatively different from the tokens used to construct the source code of the program." - Program Understanding...

Toward a Perceptual Science of Multidimensional Data Visualization: Bertin and Beyond discusses that info visualisations can be constructed by mapping one data dimension to brightness, colors or orientations, however, it goes on to say that in practice this does not work very well. \"Humans can only perceive a limited number of data dimensions\".

Discusses fundamental graphic primitives/procedures as invariants, components, correspondences and marks. Components define variational concepts. Invariants relate components. Marks (three types/ \"implantations\" incl. point, line and area) are graphical representations on the visualisation that represent invariants. Correspondences are the relationships between and among components.

Discusses that there are two \"Functionally different classes of visual variable\" including planar and retinal variables. Planar includes any spatial information and retinal variables include things such as size, color, shape, orientation, texture and brightness (which can use marks to be displayed).

(Check source) Bertin states that it is only possible to effectively map three graphic variables including two planar dimensions and one retinal dimension.

Bertin also did not discuss motion within his variables. Investigation of this in the context of temporal visualisation would be enlightening.
