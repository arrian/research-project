\label{chap:introduction}

\begin{chapquote}{Frederick Brooks, \textit{The Mythical Man-Month}, p.185}
``In spite of progress in restricting and simplifying the structures of software, they remain inherently unvisualizable, thus depriving the mind of some of its most powerful conceptual tools. This lack not only impedes the process of design within one mind, it severely hinders communication among minds.''

Visualisations bridge the gap between understanding and enjoyment. \more

In software, visualisations have attempted to provide a higher level of understanding but have rarely been effective in communicating the fundamental processes of software development. The Mythical Man-Month goes so far as to suggest that ``software is invisible and unvisualizable''\cite{Brooks1995} sparking debate as to the effectiveness of all software visualisations used in the understanding of software.

Within the last two decades, the introduction and development of ``live coding'' has presented a unique application space for visualisations and the potential for effective communication directly with audiences. These new developments could challenge the long-held belief that ``software is invisible and unvisualizable''.

The intention of software visualisations is to communicate software effectively. In recent years there has been a push to develop effective software visualisations as the audience of software becomes more diverse, multidisciplinary teams within the industry become the standard, and multimedia and the arts become more focussed on effective software development. Live coding presents a space in which a wide audience and dynamic software is common and presents a space in which visualisations could provide significant benefit to the experience of observers. Live coding is a means of combining the artistic goal of enjoyment and the educational aspects associated with programming with visualisations to effectively communicate software.

This thesis investigates the proposition that ``code visualisation improves the experience of observers'' in the setting of a live arts practice. More specifically, this thesis investigates the question: ``can the application of visualisation techniques to live coding enhance audience experience by increasing understanding and enjoyment?''. These questions were examined through a process of prototype development, user study evaluation and refinement.

The application of software visualisations to the process of live coding has been explored. A process of design iteration and evaluation was conducted in collaboration with a live coding  artist to develop software visualisations. Three studies were administered, including one field study and two laboratory studies as a means to determine if understanding and enjoyment could be influenced by the introduction of visualisations to live coding.

\section{Background}

For most of its history, source code has been displayed as simple text. This is due to the expressiveness of the text format and despite its inefficiencies. It is only recently, due to ever increasing programming language complexity, increasing screen fidelity and increasing computational power, that code annotations and syntax highlighting have become more commonplace. Nevertheless, these visual enhancements rarely provide information beyond the basic grammar of the language they are intended to augment. The limitations of this approach are becoming ever more apparent as programming languages and interactive programming environments move towards the need for real-time comprehension and a need to understand the source code within the context of a running program.

A number of modern software environments are supporting the concept of hotswapping source code. Within software environments, hotswapping refers to the process of modifying program source code at runtime to achieve desired behaviour without interrupting or restarting the system. Examples of languages and platforms supporting this workflow include Java with HotSwap or JRebel~\cite{ZeroTurnaround2014} and Python, in addition to a variety of other custom platforms and modifications (e.g.~\cite{Thomas2011}). This workflow has also inspired the programming practice of ``live coding''. 

Live coding further develops the concept of hotswapping source code, applying it to live musical and visual performance. In live coding a programmer performs for an audience. The audience observes the programmer as they modify an active program to produce music and visuals. Some of the most important and influential live coding environments over the last decade have included SuperCollider~\cite{McCartney}, ChucK~\cite{Wang2008} and Extempore~\cite{Sorensen}. These environments have a growing following as the field of live coding matures.

\section{Related Work}

Modern visualisation generally has two distinct definitions. The first definition involves representing data graphically while the other definition describes the process of forming mental visual images. {\color{red} Both processes can assist in the communication and understanding of information}

Since its inception, the visualisation of data has revolutionised how information is represented and understood. The earliest examples of summarising data using images occurred in William Playfair's \textit{The Commercial and Political Atlas}. Playfair developed a number of graphical representations of data that are very common today including the line chart, the bar chart and the pie chart.

Exisiting source code visualisations such as Gource~\cite{Caudwell2010} (Figure~\ref{fig:gource}) and Code Swarm~\cite{Ogawa2012} (Figure~\ref{fig:code-swarm}) show historic source code changes, based off source code respository data. Inline annotations~\cite{Swift2013} provide direct feedback directly useful to the programmer and technologies such Light Table~\cite{Kodowa2014} with an inline interactive terminal or \ac{REPL} have further identified the need to provide more visual information regarding active programs.

Chapter~\ref{chap:user-study} summarises the first user study conducted with the visualisation prototype. Chapter~\ref{chap:visualisation-refinement} discusses refinement of the visualisation prototype motivated by the results of the first user study. Chapter~\ref{chap:follow-up-user-study} discusses the follow-up user study conducted to analyse the refined visualisations. Chapter~\ref{chap:summary} summarises the results of the user studies, contributions, limitations and future work. Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} provides some final words to conclude the thesis.
