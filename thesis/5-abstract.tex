The visualisation of ``live coding'' computer music performance was evaluated as a means to enhance programmer and observer communication. Following an exploratory field study conducted during a live coding performance at an arts festival, interaction-driven visualisation techniques were incorporated into a live coding system. Through a process of visualisation evaluation and refinement, two controlled laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the visualisations' contributions to the audience experience, with emphasis on the (self-reported) experiential dimensions of \emph{understanding} and \emph{enjoyment}.

Results of the three studies are indicative of the potential for visualisations within live coding in enhancing the experience of the audience.
