Live coding is a method of performance that presents audio and visual content to audiences through programming. Often \"showing the code\" is a fundamental part of the performance in order to retain the attention of the audience and provide a measure of authenticity.




Currently missing within the research within live coding is a visualisation of the code that represents the artists intent. Previous visualisation techniques present an abstract and often disjoint representation from the associated code. Missing within this context is a formal analysis of how to best represent the artist's intent visually and a formal analysis of the target audience.
