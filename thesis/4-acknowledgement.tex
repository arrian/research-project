\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

This has been an incredibly interesting and challenging year. I have many to thank for their support and guidance through the challenges encountered.

I would like to thank my supervisors, Henry Gardner and Ben Swift for their motivating words and inspiring dreams of what can be achieved through visualisation, live coding, and the combination of the arts and sciences. In particular, my appreciation goes to Henry for his positivity, guiding me and pushing me when I needed it the most. My appreciation goes to Ben for his dedication and patience in seeing this project succeed and the many hours he has spent in support of this.

My appreciation goes to those who have kept the office environment interesting. Charles, for the conversation and support particularly during the critical periods. Torben and Matt, for the warm welcome and interesting perspectives. 

Finally, I would like to thank my family, friends and work colleagues who have put up with my abscene or vacant stares throughout this project. In particular I would like to thank Emily and Damien for their support of the project and making the honours environment interesting; Sahan, for always smiling; Ben Frommel, for his support through the project, despite my absence, the adventures we have had and adventures still to come; and finally, my mother for an overwhelming level of support throughout the year. Thank you all.
