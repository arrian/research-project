In this first empirical study of audience perception of code visualisation in live coding, we have identified an opportunity for real-time code visualisations to help improve the audience experience of a live coding computer music performance. With few exceptions, our initial survey of a live coding performance at an arts festival revealed a generally low to medium level of audience understanding throughout that performance (although almost half the survey respondents indicated a high level of enjoyment throughout).

In a subsequent lab study, a comparison of two prototype code visualisations indicated that both visualisations seemed to help with enjoyment. Significantly more audience members reported that our didactic visualisations helped with understanding but overall trends for both enjoyment and understanding throughout the performances were complex. There are indications of a higher cognitive load for the didactic visualisations than the aesthetic visualisations and this may have influenced audience responses to them.

In a future extension of this work, design lessons from both visualisation types could be combined together to produce live coding driven visualisations which targeted both the aesthetics as well as a greater understanding of the live coding process. These visualisations could then be compared with the baseline ``no visualisation'' condition in an audience experiment. There are also opportunities to vary the nature of the visualisations over the course of a performance.

	-where is the potential for visualisations in live coding
