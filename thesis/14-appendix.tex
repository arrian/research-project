\chapter{Field Study Survey}
\label{appendix:field-study-survey}

This survey was presented to the audience during the exploratory field study (see Chapter~\ref{chap:exploratory-field-study}). The audience had the option of completing the survey either through a paper-based (as shown in this section) or online medium.

\chapter{Field Study Follow-Up Interviews}
\label{appendix:field-study-follow-up-interviews}

The initial exploratory field study (see Chapter~\ref{chap:exploratory-field-study}) prompted a number of questions. These questions were examined through a number of email based follow-up interviews (for context, see Section~\ref{section:study-1-follow-up-interview}). The responses to these follow-up interviews are presented below. Questions asked are italicised.

\chapter{User Study Advertisement}
\label{appendix:user-study-advertisement}

The initial user study (see Chapter~\ref{chap:user-study}) was advertised throughout the university campus including through social groups and posters. The poster used to advertise the study is included below for reference.

\chapter{User Study Survey}
\label{appendix:user-study-survey}

The initial user study (see Chapter~\ref{chap:user-study}) investigated the application of the developed visualisation to the space of live coding computer music performance. The survey used to evaluate these visualisations is presented below.

\chapter{Live Coder Interview Transcript}
\label{appendix:live-coder-interview-transcript}

This appendix contains the transcript of an interview conducted with the live coder (Ben Swift) following the first user study (see Chapter~\ref{chap:user-study}, specifically Section~\ref{section:study-2-follow-up-interview} for context). The first two performances were discussed with a goal of determining the differences in the mental model between the audience and the live coder.

\chapter{Follow-Up User Study Survey}
\label{appendix:follow-up-user-study-survey}

The follow-up user study (see Chapter~\ref{chap:follow-up-user-study}) investigated the differences between the application of no visualisations and visualisations to the space of live coding computer music performance. The survey used to evaluate the audience response to these conditions is presented below.
